Axa Project
===========

Axa is a ecosystem development project that aims to create
libraries and tools to ease programming with Lua.


Why Lua?
--------

Lua has one of the simplest programming syntaxes, at the
same time that can emulate almost all programming paradigms. Also
is the scripting languages with lowest memory footprints.

A good point is that Lua is only the core of language. While it have
only very basic functions in its standard library, it empower users
to write things in its own way. Such minimalism avoid the core language
avoid it of become heavy, complex and bloated.


Axa Mission
-----------

Axa intends to help Lua become an universal scripting language, not as
an extension for other languages, but as a standalone too.

What need to be done, so? Why should be other Lua project?

1. **Provide simple and well documented critical modules.** Some basic
things needs today two or three different dependencies, some lacking
functionality, others not well documented and others staled or lacking
support for newer Lua versions.

2. **Avoid boilerplate.** If developers feel comfortable with
their tool, them go further and do more.

2. **Ecosystem.** Provide development tools to enhance the Lua modules
development, documentation and test. Example: T3D (Test Documentation
Driven Development), test container, documentation tools etc.
